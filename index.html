            </h2>
        <p>
            September 11 attacks, also called 9/11 attacks, series of airline hijackings and suicide attacks committed in 2001 by 19 militants associated with the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda against targets in the United States, the deadliest terrorist attacks on American soil in U.S. history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attacks against New York City and Washington, D.C., caused extensive death and destruction and triggered an enormous U.S. effort to combat terrorism. Some 2,750 people were killed in New York, 184 at the Pentagon, and 40 in Pennsylvania (where one of the hijacked planes crashed after the passengers attempted to retake the plane); all 19 terrorists died (see Researcher’s Note: September 11 attacks). Police and fire departments in New York were especially hard-hit: hundreds had rushed to the scene of the attacks, and more than 400 police officers and firefighters were killed.

                What was the motives behind the 9/11?
                </span>
        </h2>
        <ul>
             <li>Ideological extremism: Al-Qaeda was driven by a radical Islamist ideology that sought to establish a global caliphate based on their strict interpretation of Islam. They believed that the United States, as a superpower and a symbol of Western influence, posed a threat to their religious and political goals.</li>

             <li>Opposition to U.S. foreign policy: Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden expressed strong opposition to U.S. foreign policy, particularly its military presence in the Middle East and its support for Israel. They saw American intervention as a form of aggression and sought to retaliate against what they viewed as unjust actions.</li>

             <li>Response to perceived injustices: The 9/11 attackers perceived a series of historical grievances, including the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War, economic sanctions against Iraq, and U.S. support for Israel in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These perceived injustices played a role in motivating the attackers to carry out their plan.
             </li>

             <li>
             Symbolic significance: The World Trade Center, a prominent symbol of American economic power, and the Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense, were chosen as targets to maximize the impact of the attacks. The attackers aimed to undermine the United States both economically and militarily while sending a message of defiance and strength to their supporters.
             </li>

             <li>
                Recruitment and propaganda: The 9/11 attacks were also intended to serve as a powerful propaganda tool to attract new recruits to al-Qaeda's cause. The large-scale and high-profile nature of the attacks aimed to inspire others and generate fear and instability within Western societies.
             </li>

                <strong>It's important to note that the motives listed here are based on the analysis and statements made by al-Qaeda leaders, as well as various investigations and studies conducted in the aftermath of the attacks.</strong>
